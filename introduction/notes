1. Difference btw Map and reduce:
-Map : transforms each element of an array and returns a new array.
-Reduce: combines all the elements of an array into a single value.

2. Map function accepts callback function that is called for each element in the array, and an optional thisArg parameter
 that sets the value of this inside the callback function.

3. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments and run after a task is completed.

4. difference btw let and var:
the main difference is their scope.
-let : variables declared with let are blocked-scoped.
-var: variables  declared with var are function-scoped.

5. JavaScript has 2 scopes: Global and Local(Function scope and block scope)

6. Module scope: code.js(structure.js, main.js, utils.js)

 4 concept of opp: Encapsulation-> is same as separation of concerns, it is also hiding of information and behaviour into an object
 Abstraction: is hiding a behavior or the inner working of an object. hiding implementations.
 methods: Are behavior
 classes: A template 
 polymorphism: object that inherit from another but implement the method differently
 inheritance: is about method sharing.
